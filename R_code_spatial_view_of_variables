# R spatial algothrithms related to R

#recall sp package in R
## or to intall the package remember install.packages("sp")
library(sp)

# Load meuse data set 
data(meuse)
head(meuse)

## x and y in data set are the spatial coordinates we need to be using today 
# coordinates() to tell R we need to make use of coordinates 
coordinates(meuse)

# remember the "~" symbol groups things together
  # now group the x and y with the coordinates
  
coordiantes(meuse)=~x+y
#this tells R that we x and y are its coordinates 
#this allows us to see this data in space

#Lets see one of the elements spread out in space within the data set!
#  spplot() function alows you do see where the zinc is higher and lower in particular points (x,y) on the plot!
#       used to plot how elements are spread in space 
spplot(meuse,"zinc")

#lets add a title 
spplot(meuse,"zinc",main="Concentration of Zinc in Space")

#Lets try for Copper!
spplot(meuse,"copper",main="Concentration of Copper in Space")

## tremendous excersise for us!!
## see copper and zinc together!

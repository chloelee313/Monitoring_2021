# R spatial algothrithms related to R

#recall sp package in R
## or to intall the package remember install.packages("sp")
library(sp)

# Load meuse data set 
data(meuse)
head(meuse)

## x and y in data set are the spatial coordinates we need to be using today 
# coordinates() to tell R we need to make use of coordinates 
coordinates(meuse)

# remember the "~" symbol groups things together
  # now group the x and y with the coordinates
  
coordiantes(meuse)=~x+y
#this tells R that we x and y are its coordinates 
#this allows us to see this data in space

#Lets see one of the elements spread out in space within the data set!
#  spplot() function alows you do see where the zinc is higher and lower in particular points (x,y) on the plot!
#       used to plot how elements are spread in space 
spplot(meuse,"zinc")

#lets add a title 
spplot(meuse,"zinc",main="Concentration of Zinc in Space")

#Lets try for Copper!
spplot(meuse,"copper",main="Concentration of Copper in Space")

## Tremendous Excersise:
## see copper and zinc together!
#       an array example primates<-c(1,5,10)
            #same solution for the first lecture 
spplot(meuse, c("copper","zinc"))

#Lets create a Bubble plot with data (rather than using colors)
  #dimension of point will change based on amount of the element in the field
bubble(meuse,"zinc")

# VERY POWERFUL 

#Excersize, do the same for lead
bubble(meuse,"lead")

#Change the color now!
bubble(meuse, "lead", col="red")
